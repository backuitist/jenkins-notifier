# Jenkins Notifier

Loosely based on <https://github.com/alberto/hudson-notifier>

Works for just one project. If you need multiple project well, run the script multiple times! 

There's no GUI for configuration. Instead hack into the jenkins-notifier.py and update URL & JOB accordingly.

There are 2 versions
- the default version for python3
- the old version for python2 - suffers from urllib2 network problems..
